# ApplicationUpdater
A modular version of how my PowerShell window form applications check for updates. Made modular in order to make it easier to maintain across all apps.
Feel free to download, modify and use this in your own project if you'd like, its however designed specifically for my own needs.

# To Do
- Create better logic for getting latest release 'number'
- Provide direct download links for release attachments
- Provide 'Install' funtion (Download new release, close current open version of applciation, open newly downloaded version)
- Make more visually pleasing
